/**
 * What may be polished, and what the editor has to be told to replace it.
 *
 * The Apple keyboard polishes the user's *selection*: they highlight a sentence, tap 润色, and the
 * panel offers a rewrite of exactly that. HarmonyOS gives an input method no way to read a
 * selection — `InputClient` offers `getForwardSync` (before the caret) and `getBackwardSync`
 * (after it), and the selection is only ever reported to the keyboard as a pair of indices — so
 * copying the gesture would mean drawing a button that cannot know what it is acting on.
 *
 * The adaptation is to polish the text immediately before the caret: the message the user has just
 * finished typing. That is the same intent, expressed with what this platform does provide, and on
 * a phone it is also the more natural gesture — type, then tidy.
 *
 * Everything here is arithmetic and eligibility. The request itself is `HarmonyVoicePolisher`,
 * which is already this host's polisher and already allows the newlines a rewritten paragraph
 * contains; the panel is ArkUI. Neither can be tested off a device, and both are less likely to be
 * wrong than the question of how much text to take and how much to delete.
 */

/**
 * How much text before the caret is offered.
 *
 * Apple's ceiling is ten thousand characters, which is a sensible bound on something the user has
 * deliberately selected. Nothing is being selected here: this is read speculatively every time the
 * panel opens, so the number is a bound on what one editor read costs rather than on the user's
 * intent. A long message is a few hundred characters.
